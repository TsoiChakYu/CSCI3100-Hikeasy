# Backend Sub-Repo
This is the sub-repo of the backend of the Project.

In the initial design document, we decided to utilize NodeJS as the backend language. \
The majority has also agreed to use TypeScript together with NodeJS; \
in particular, Strict TypeScript is adopted. \
(Weak TypeScript is the variant of TypeScript caused by improper configuration of the TypeScript environment, allowing some TS errors to pass through the build process.) \
We have also decided to utilize MySQL as the data storage mechanism.

Package management is handled by NPM.
